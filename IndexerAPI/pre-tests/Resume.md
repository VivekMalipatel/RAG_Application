Job Vaults - AI Job Applications Tracker | Open AI GPT, Apache Kafka, ExpressJS, NodeJS, ReactJS, Regex, Machine Learning, Anaconda, REST, Python

• Developed “Job Vaults,” an AI-driven tool that automatically reads user emails from multiple providers and compiles a consolidated report of job applications,

eliminating the need for manual Excel tracking and significantly reducing human error

• Architected a fault-tolerant data ingestion pipeline using Apache Kafka for high-throughput email processing (5K–6K/month/user), employing offset

management and multi-threaded Python consumers for robust data cleaning and preprocessing. Integrated fine-tuned GPT 4o mini for extracting job-related
entities with 90% accuracy, orchestrated by ExpressJS-based microservices

• Leveraged MongoDB for scalable storage with token-based encryption to protect user data, implemented efficient indexing for rapid lookups, and displayed

real-time insights on a ReactJS front end. Maintained a stateless architecture for easy scalability and high availability

Advanced Database Organisation | lldb, Header files, Makefiles, Linux, Modular programming in C Language, DBMS

• Co-developed a scalable database storage architecture in C, optimizing buffer and record management while implementing efficient B+ tree indexing, achieving

a 30% improvement in file operation speed.

• Implemented multiple page replacement strategies (FIFO, CLOCK, LFU, LRU) in buffer management, improving memory efficiency by 25%. Enhanced record

management by designing primary key and tombstone features, and extended B+ tree indexing to support diverse data types, increasing data retrieval speed by
20%

AI-Powered Software Project Planning Tool | LangChain, AutoGen, OpenAI GPT-4o Mini, Python, Agile & Waterfall Methodologies

• Implemented a multi-agent system using autogen and LangChain to simulate an end-to-end Scrum and Waterfall workflow, where each Python-based agent

(Requirement Engineer, System Engineer, etc.) autonomously generated project artifacts such as requirements, designs, code estimates, and test plans

• Leveraged environment variables via dotenv for secure GPT-4o-mini integration, orchestrating nested conversation flows and extracting structured data (effort

estimates, sprint plans) to produce a comprehensive, AI-driven project plan

• Created extensible ConversableAgent classes that handle role-based interactions (Scrum Master, Product Owner), using the conversation logs to dynamically

compile final project documentation and backlog items for each development phase
Fake News Classification | Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Machine Learning, Python

• Developed multiple supervised machine learning models (Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) for text classification using Scikit-learn, achieving up

to 85% accuracy on labeled datasets

• Performed data engineering and natural language processing, including re-sampling techniques, resulting in an average accuracy of 85% and a precision of 0.83

on test datasets
