Analysis of Entity and Relationship Extraction in Chunked Documents

Your research highlights the core challenge of maintaining entity and relationship consistency across document chunks while balancing local vs. global context. Here‚Äôs my breakdown:

‚∏ª

Key Challenges Identified
	1.	Fragmented Entities & Relationships
	‚Ä¢	Chunking disrupts global entity linking.
	‚Ä¢	Relationships spanning multiple chunks may not be properly extracted.
	2.	Limited Context Window
	‚Ä¢	Processing chunks independently limits context for accurate entity recognition.
	‚Ä¢	Entities with partial mentions across chunks may be misclassified.
	3.	Handling Entity Continuations
	‚Ä¢	Some entities span multiple chunks (e.g., multi-line names, legal clauses).
	‚Ä¢	Relationship dependencies might be broken if context is lost.
	4.	Metadata as Entities
	‚Ä¢	Document name, MIME type, User ID should also be considered as entities.
	‚Ä¢	These metadata entities can provide valuable context for search retrieval.

‚∏ª

Potential Solutions

Your research outlines several practical strategies that align well with our modular pipeline. I‚Äôll categorize them based on feasibility and integration potential.

1. Structured Chunking Approach

‚úîÔ∏è Best Choice: ‚úÖ Adaptive Chunking with Entity Continuation Merging

üîπ Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Use title-based dynamic chunking (as already implemented).
	‚Ä¢	Identify chunks marked as ‚Äúis_continuation‚Äù and merge them before extraction.
	‚Ä¢	This ensures entity spans remain intact while keeping context cohesive.

üîπ Advantages:
	‚Ä¢	Prevents partial entity extraction (e.g., ‚ÄúJohn Doe‚Äù being split).
	‚Ä¢	Preserves relationships across chunk boundaries.

‚∏ª

2. Cross-Chunk Entity Consistency

‚úîÔ∏è Best Choice: ‚úÖ Centralized Entity Registry with Coreference Resolution

üîπ Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Maintain an entity reference store across all chunks in a document.
	‚Ä¢	Use coreference resolution to track duplicate mentions of entities.
	‚Ä¢	Merge duplicate entities into a canonical representation.

üîπ Example Scenario:
	‚Ä¢	Chunk 1: ‚ÄúGoogle was founded by Larry Page.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Chunk 3: ‚ÄúPage later stepped down as CEO.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Instead of treating ‚ÄúPage‚Äù as a separate entity, coreference resolution links it to ‚ÄúLarry Page‚Äù.

üîπ Implementation Plan:
	‚Ä¢	First pass: Extract entities per chunk.
	‚Ä¢	Second pass: Resolve duplicates across chunks.

üîπ Tools:
	‚Ä¢	spaCy‚Äôs coreference module
	‚Ä¢	Hugging Face Long-Context Models

‚∏ª

3. Relationship Extraction with Partial Context

‚úîÔ∏è Best Choice: ‚úÖ Two-Pass Relationship Extraction

üîπ Approach:
	‚Ä¢	First pass: Extract individual entity relationships per chunk.
	‚Ä¢	Second pass: Reprocess extracted relationships using global entity context.

üîπ Example Scenario:
	‚Ä¢	Chunk 1: ‚ÄúTesla manufactures electric cars.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Chunk 5: ‚ÄúElon Musk leads Tesla.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	A single pass might miss the Elon Musk ‚Üí Tesla relationship.
	‚Ä¢	A second pass rechecks entities globally and refines missing links.

üîπ Implementation Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Phase 1: Basic per-chunk relationship extraction (already covered).
	‚Ä¢	Phase 2: Post-processing using entity knowledge from previous chunks.

‚∏ª

4. Metadata as Entities

‚úîÔ∏è Best Choice: ‚úÖ Augment Entity Extraction with Metadata Context

üîπ Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Treat document metadata as special entities (e.g., user_id, mime_type).
	‚Ä¢	Store metadata in Neo4j for retrieval.
	‚Ä¢	This helps in semantic search & document retrieval.

üîπ Implementation Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Modify text_processor.py to extract metadata.
	‚Ä¢	Store metadata entities in Neo4j.

üîπ Example Metadata as Entities:

{
    "document_name": "Research Paper on AI.pdf",
    "mime_type": "application/pdf",
    "user_id": "123456",
    "extracted_entities": [
        {"text": "Artificial Intelligence", "type": "Topic"},
        {"text": "John Doe", "type": "Author"}
    ]
}



‚∏ª

5. Efficient Retrieval from Graph Database

‚úîÔ∏è Best Choice: ‚úÖ Neo4j Query Optimizations

üîπ Approach:
	‚Ä¢	Store cross-chunk entity references in Neo4j.
	‚Ä¢	Enhance search queries to prioritize relationships spanning multiple chunks.

üîπ Implementation Plan:
	‚Ä¢	Modify graph_storage.py to store cross-chunk entity mappings.
	‚Ä¢	Implement Neo4j queries for retrieving entity relationships.
	‚Ä¢	Enable fuzzy matching to resolve entity variations.

üîπ Example Query:

MATCH (e:Entity)-[r:RELATION]->(t:Entity)
WHERE e.name CONTAINS "Tesla" OR t.name CONTAINS "Tesla"
RETURN e, r, t

Next Steps

Based on the analysis, the next priority task is to modify our existing text processor to implement:
	1.	Chunk Continuation Merging
	‚Ä¢	Identify is_continuation chunks and merge them before entity extraction.
	2.	Cross-Chunk Entity Registry
	‚Ä¢	Maintain a temporary entity store across chunks.
	‚Ä¢	Implement coreference resolution.
	3.	Two-Pass Relationship Extraction
	‚Ä¢	Extract basic relationships per chunk.
	‚Ä¢	Enhance relationships in a second pass using global entity context.
	4.	Metadata as Entities
	‚Ä¢	Extract document metadata as special entities.
	‚Ä¢	Store them in Neo4j for search optimization.

Would you like to proceed with modifying text_processor.py first, or set up the entity registry in neo4j_handler.py first? üöÄ

Thank you for the detailed review! Your feedback is spot-on, and I agree with the areas for consideration. Based on this, we will proceed in the following order:

‚∏ª

Immediate Implementation Plan
	1.	Modify text_processor.py for Enhanced Entity Extraction
	‚Ä¢	Integrate Chunk Continuation Merging
	‚Ä¢	Identify is_continuation chunks and merge them before entity extraction.
	‚Ä¢	Extract Metadata as Entities
	‚Ä¢	Include document metadata (e.g., document_name, mime_type, user_id) as entities.
	2.	Implement Cross-Chunk Entity Registry
	‚Ä¢	Store extracted entities in a temporary cache across chunks.
	‚Ä¢	Implement coreference resolution to link duplicate mentions across chunks.
	3.	Implement Two-Pass Relationship Extraction
	‚Ä¢	First Pass: Extract relationships per chunk.
	‚Ä¢	Second Pass: Refine relationships using global entity context.
	4.	Store Extracted Entities & Relationships in Neo4j
	‚Ä¢	Modify neo4j_handler.py to:
	‚Ä¢	Store extracted entities in the graph database.
	‚Ä¢	Create relationships between entities.
	‚Ä¢	Optimize retrieval queries using fuzzy matching.

‚∏ª

Addressing Computational Costs
	1.	Incremental Processing
	‚Ä¢	Instead of processing all chunks at once, process them sequentially and store intermediate results.
	2.	Asynchronous Entity Registry Updates
	‚Ä¢	Update the global entity registry asynchronously, ensuring minimal blocking in the pipeline.
	3.	Selective Two-Pass Execution
	‚Ä¢	Only apply the second pass when necessary (e.g., if a chunk contains entity mentions that also appeared in previous chunks).

‚∏ª

Next Steps
	‚Ä¢	I will start by modifying text_processor.py to handle chunk continuation merging and metadata extraction.
	‚Ä¢	Once done, we will proceed with building the entity registry and Neo4j integration.
