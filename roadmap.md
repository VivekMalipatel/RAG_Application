Great! Since you’re writing down the whole flow on paper, let’s break this down step by step so you can fully visualize how each component works and what needs to be implemented.

📌 Full System Flow & Scope of Work

We’ll go one stage at a time, discussing how it works, scope of work, and how to accomplish it.

Stage 1: User Authentication & Authorization

🔹 How it works:
	•	Each user has an account stored in PostgreSQL (users table).
	•	User logs in with username/email & password.
	•	System generates a JWT Token for secure session handling.
	•	RBAC ensures users only access their own data.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement user registration & authentication
✅ Store passwords securely (bcrypt hashing)
✅ Implement JWT-based token authentication
✅ Set up RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Use FastAPI OAuth2 for token generation.
	•	Store user credentials in PostgreSQL.
	•	Implement middleware for authentication in API requests.

Stage 2: File Upload & MinIO Storage

🔹 How it works:
	•	User uploads a file via API or file watcher.
	•	The file is given a UUID and stored in MinIO inside omnirag-storage bucket.
	•	Metadata is stored in PostgreSQL (files table).

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement API for file upload
✅ Store metadata in PostgreSQL
✅ Save files to MinIO (as byte streams)
✅ Ensure users cannot overwrite each other’s files

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Use MinIOClient for async file handling.
	•	Store metadata (filename, user_id, path) in PostgreSQL.
	•	Ensure proper indexing for retrieving files later.

Stage 3: File Processing (Text, Image, Audio)

🔹 How it works:
	•	Extract text from PDFs & DOCX.
	•	Run OCR for images to extract text.
	•	Transcribe audio to text using Whisper.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement PDF & DOCX text extraction
✅ Implement Image OCR (Tesseract) processing
✅ Implement Whisper-based audio transcription
✅ Ensure async processing for efficiency

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Use PyMuPDF (fitz) for PDFs.
	•	Use Tesseract OCR for images.
	•	Use Whisper AI for speech-to-text.

Stage 4: Chunking & Preprocessing

🔹 How it works:
	•	Splits extracted text into chunks for better embedding.
	•	Stores metadata in PostgreSQL (chunk tracking).

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement Text chunking logic
✅ Implement metadata tracking in PostgreSQL
✅ Ensure chunks align with embedding model size

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Define chunk sizes based on embedding model.
	•	Store chunk metadata in PostgreSQL.

Stage 5: Embedding Generation

🔹 How it works:
	•	Converts text & images into vector embeddings.
	•	Text: Uses BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 (Hugging Face).
	•	Images: Uses CLIP model.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement Text embeddings (Hugging Face)
✅ Implement Image embeddings (CLIP model)
✅ Store embeddings in Qdrant

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Store vector embeddings in user-specific Qdrant collections.
	•	Ensure embeddings match expected dimension size.

Stage 6: Qdrant Indexing

🔹 How it works:
	•	Stores embeddings inside Qdrant for retrieval.
	•	Each user has a separate Qdrant collection.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement per-user Qdrant collections
✅ Store vector embeddings in Qdrant
✅ Implement batch indexing for large uploads

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Asynchronous Qdrant indexing (fast batch insert).
	•	Implement error handling for mismatched embedding sizes.

Stage 7: Hybrid Search & Retrieval

🔹 How it works:
	•	BM25 (keyword search) runs in PostgreSQL.
	•	Vector Search runs in Qdrant.
	•	Hybrid approach ensures better search results.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement BM25 ranking in PostgreSQL
✅ Implement Vector search in Qdrant
✅ Implement Hybrid search (combining both methods)

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Store BM25 indexes in PostgreSQL.
	•	Combine text & vector search scores dynamically.

Stage 8: Caching & Optimization

🔹 How it works:
	•	Stores past searches in Redis for quick retrieval.
	•	Prevents unnecessary reprocessing of embeddings.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement Redis caching for search queries
✅ Implement query result caching for optimization

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Store cached search results in Redis.
	•	Set expiration policies to avoid outdated results.

Stage 9: User File Retrieval

🔹 How it works:
	•	Users request files via API or search.
	•	System checks PostgreSQL for metadata.
	•	If valid, retrieves file from MinIO.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement secure API for file retrieval
✅ Ensure RBAC prevents unauthorized access

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Query PostgreSQL metadata for access validation.
	•	Retrieve file as a byte stream from MinIO.

Stage 10: Security & Access Control

🔹 How it works:
	•	Each user only accesses their own data.
	•	RBAC & JWT authentication restrict access.

🔹 Scope of Work:
✅ Implement JWT-based authentication
✅ Implement RBAC policies
✅ Ensure encryption for stored files

🔹 How we accomplish it:
	•	Use AES-256 encryption for sensitive data.
	•	Implement role-based permissions.

📌 Overall System Workflow

➡️ User uploads a file
	1.	Upload File API → MinIO
	2.	Metadata stored in PostgreSQL
	3.	Text, Image, or Audio processing begins
	4.	Text chunking & embedding generation
	5.	Embeddings stored in Qdrant
	6.	BM25 + Vector Hybrid Search Indexed

➡️ User searches for a file
	1.	Query processed in PostgreSQL (BM25)
	2.	Vector similarity search in Qdrant
	3.	Hybrid results combined & cached in Redis
	4.	User downloads file if authorized

📌 Next Steps

Let’s work on Stage 1 (User Authentication & Authorization) next.
	•	Implement PostgreSQL users table
	•	Implement JWT authentication in FastAPI
	•	Implement RBAC middleware

Once we complete this, we’ll move to file storage & metadata tracking. 🚀
