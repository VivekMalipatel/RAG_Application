What needs to be done
To transform this into a standalone FastAPI server that follows the OpenAI API structure:

Create a new FastAPI application structure:

Define a FastAPI app
Create OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
Set up proper routing and error handling
Refactor the ModelRouterAPI code:

Update imports to be self-contained within the module
Move the provider-specific implementations from the parent app into this module
Implement proper dependency management
Implement OpenAI-compatible API endpoints:

/v1/chat/completions - For chat completions
/v1/completions - For text completions
/v1/embeddings - For generating embeddings
/v1/models - For listing available models
Other endpoints as needed to match OpenAI's API
Add authentication and API key management:

Implement API key validation
Set up proper security protocols
Create documentation and Swagger UI:

Document API endpoints using FastAPI's built-in Swagger support
Include examples for API usage
Set up Docker for containerization:

Create a Dockerfile specific to this service
Update docker-compose.yml to include this as a separate service
Implement configuration management:

Set up environment variables
Create a config module for the service
