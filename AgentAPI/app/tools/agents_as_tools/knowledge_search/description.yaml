knowledge_search_agent: |
  A specialized agent for intelligently searching and querying the user's knowledge base through a knowledge graph database. This tool provides comprehensive search capabilities across all ingested organizational content.

  **Core Capabilities:**
  - Search unstructured documents (PDFs, images, text files) using content and metadata
  - Query structured data (CSV, Excel files) including columns and row values
  - Find entities (people, organizations, concepts) and their relationships
  - Perform semantic similarity searches using AI embeddings
  - Retrieve specific document content and metadata
  - Analyze connections and relationships between different data points
  - Support both exact matching and fuzzy/semantic search strategies

  **When to Use This Tool:**
  - User asks about internal documents, files, or organizational data
  - Requests for "our documents", "company information", or specific filenames
  - Questions about content within ingested documents
  - Analysis of relationships between entities in the knowledge base
  - Discovery queries like "what documents do we have" or "list available files"

  **How to Use:**
  Provide clear, detailed task descriptions explaining exactly what information is needed. Include relevant context about the user's goal and any specific requirements.

  **Effective Task Examples:**
  - "Find and list all documents in the knowledge base with their metadata and categories"
  - "Search for content related to machine learning across all ingested documents"
  - "Retrieve the full content from any documents with 'Q4 Report' in the filename"
  - "Find entities of type 'Person' and show their relationships to other entities"

  **Important Constraints:**
  - Only searches within ingested knowledge base data
  - Cannot access external websites or current information
  - Results are automatically filtered by user/organization permissions
  - If information isn't in the knowledge base, will respond with "No relevant information found"

  **Output Format:**
  Returns structured search results with relevant content, metadata, and context. Results are organized and filtered based on user permissions and relevance to the query.
