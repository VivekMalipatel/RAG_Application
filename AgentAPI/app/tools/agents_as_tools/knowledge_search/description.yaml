  - Find entities and their relationships
  - Perform vector similarity searches using embeddings
  - Retrieve document metadata and content
  - Analyze connections between different data points

  The agent can handle complex queries about the user's knowledge base and returns relevant information with proper filtering based on user and organization context. It supports both text-based searches and semantic similarity searches to find the most relevant information from the ingested documents and data sources.

  Use this tool when you need to search for specific information, documents, entities, or relationships within the user's knowledge base that has been processed and stored in the knowledge graph system.
