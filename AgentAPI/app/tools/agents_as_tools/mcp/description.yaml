  🎯 **MCP Agent - Intelligent MCP Operations Specialist**
  
  A sophisticated agent that serves as your dedicated MCP (Model Context Protocol) operations manager. This agent intelligently discovers, manages, and executes operations across multiple MCP servers with VS Code-like capabilities.
  
  ## 🚀 **Core Purpose**
  Acts as an autonomous specialist for all MCP-related tasks, handling the complexity of multi-server environments while providing intelligent tool discovery, health monitoring, and seamless execution.
  
  ## 🧠 **Agent Behavior**
  
  ### **Intelligent Task Processing**
  - **Understands Context**: Interprets your requests and maps them to appropriate MCP operations
  - **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically finds and catalogs available tools across all MCP servers
  - **Smart Routing**: Routes operations to the most appropriate servers and tools
  - **Workflow Orchestration**: Chains multiple MCP operations together for complex tasks
  
  ### **Autonomous Operation**
  - **Self-Managing**: Handles server connections, health checks, and error recovery independently
  - **Adaptive**: Adjusts behavior based on available servers and tools
  - **Learning**: Tracks usage patterns to optimize future operations
  - **Proactive**: Monitors server health and preemptively handles issues
  
  ## 📋 **What This Agent Can Do**
  
  ### **🔄 Dynamic Operation Discovery**
  The agent **automatically discovers** what operations are possible based on your currently configured MCP servers. It can handle:
  
  - **Any operations** provided by your connected MCP servers
  - **All tool categories** that your servers support
  - **Complex workflows** combining multiple server capabilities
  - **Cross-server operations** utilizing tools from different servers
  
  ### **📊 Example Interaction Patterns**
  Natural Language Request → Agent Analysis → Tool Discovery → Execution

  "Process this web content" → Discovers web tools → Uses screenshot/scrape → Returns results
  "Handle these files" → Discovers file tools → Uses read/write/list → Returns results
  "Check system status" → Discovers system tools → Uses monitoring tools → Returns results
  "Work with this data" → Discovers relevant tools → Uses appropriate APIs → Returns results


  ### **🎯 Capability Categories**
  The agent adapts to support whatever your MCP servers provide:
  - **Web & Browser Operations**: If web automation servers are available
  - **File System Operations**: If file system servers are connected
  - **System Information**: If system monitoring servers are active
  - **API & Network Operations**: If HTTP/API servers are configured
  - **Database Operations**: If database servers are available
  - **Custom Operations**: Any specialized tools your servers provide
