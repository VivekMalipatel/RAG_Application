## Search Types and Strategies for Knowledge Graphs

Knowledge graphs support multiple search approaches, each optimized for different query types and use cases. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of all search strategies you can perform.[1][2]

### Semantic Search Strategies

**Vector Similarity Search** uses embeddings to find semantically related nodes, edges, or content based on meaning rather than exact matches. This employs cosine similarity or K-nearest neighbors (KNN) search on embedded representations of nodes, relationships, and properties. It's ideal for conceptual queries like "find documents about machine learning" even when exact terms don't match.[3][4][5][2]

**Hybrid Search** combines vector similarity with full-text search for optimal recall and precision. This approach merges semantic understanding with keyword matching, enabling queries like "Python tutorials" to find both semantically related ML content and exact keyword matches.[4][2]

**Cross-Encoder Search** uses transformer models to jointly embed queries and results, producing relevance scores between 0-1. While more computationally expensive than bi-encoders, cross-encoders offer higher quality reranking and can use domain-specific training data.[2]

### Lexical/Text-Based Search

**Full-Text Search** performs traditional keyword matching using TF-IDF or BM25 algorithms. It includes support for logical expressions through LuceneQL and fuzzy search with Levenshtein distance for typo tolerance. This is essential for high-precision queries requiring exact term matches.[6][2]

**Named Entity Recognition (NER) Lookup** identifies specific entities mentioned in queries and retrieves compiled information about them. For example, searching for a project ID returns a dedicated page with all metadata, documents, and team members.[6]

**Fuzzy Search** handles misspellings and typos using edit distance algorithms, allowing queries to match despite character-level differences.[2]

### Graph Traversal Algorithms

**Breadth-First Search (BFS)** explores nodes level-by-level, visiting all neighbors before moving deeper. It has O(V + E) time complexity and is optimal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs. Use cases include finding direct connections in social networks, discovering multi-hop relationships, and "land and expand" searches where you start from semantically relevant nodes and expand outward.[7][8][1][2]

**Depth-First Search (DFS)** explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. With O(V + E) complexity, it's useful for cycle detection, topological sorting, and exploring deep relationship chains. DFS works well for finding paths between entities in hierarchical structures.[9][1][7]

**Shortest Path Algorithms** include Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs with non-negative weights (O((V+E)logV) complexity) and Bellman-Ford for graphs with negative weights (O(V*E) complexity). These are critical for route planning, network optimization, and finding optimal paths through relationship chains.[1][7]

### Scope-Based Search Strategies

**Edge/Relationship Search** retrieves granular facts based on query-relationship similarity. For your schema, this searches the `relation_profile` and `relation_type` fields in RELATIONSHIP edges, returning specific connections between entities.[9][2]

**Node/Entity Search** provides contextual information about specific entities by searching node names and summaries. This searches across Entity, Document, Page, and Column nodes to find relevant data points.[2][9]

**Community Search** offers high-level contextual information about clustered groups of nodes. Communities are calculated using algorithms like Leiden, Louvain, or Label Propagation to identify strongly connected clusters. This enables answering "global" questions about themes or topics spanning multiple entities.[2]

### Filtering and Constraint-Based Search

**Property Matching** performs exact lookups on node properties like `user_id`, `org_id`, `entity_type`, or `internal_object_id`. This is essential for security filtering and structured queries.[9]

**Multi-Filter Search** combines multiple constraints (AND/OR logic) to narrow results, such as finding all Documents with specific `file_type` AND `category` values for a given user.[9]

**Temporal Search** filters based on timestamps or date ranges, useful for finding recent entities or tracking changes over time.[10]

### Advanced Search Patterns

**Multi-Hop Reasoning** traverses multiple relationship types to answer complex queries. For example: "Find all Entities mentioned in Pages that belong to Documents created by user X".[11][9]

**Path Finding** discovers connections between entities through intermediate nodes. For your schema, this could trace: Entity → Page → Document → Organization to understand entity provenance.[1][9]

**Subgraph Matching** identifies patterns or motifs within the graph structure. For example, finding all Entity-RELATIONSHIP-Entity triads where both entities appear in the same document.[12][9]

**Tabular Data Navigation** follows Column → HAS_VALUE → RowValue → RELATES_TO chains to query structured data within documents. This enables SQL-like queries on embedded spreadsheet data.[9]

### Reranking Strategies

**Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)** combines multiple search result lists by assigning scores based on reciprocal rank. This is essential when combining semantic, lexical, and graph traversal results.[2]

**Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)** balances query similarity with result diversity using a lambda parameter. Higher lambda prioritizes relevance; lower values emphasize distinctiveness.[2]

**Node Distance Reranking** biases results toward nodes closer (in hop count) to a center node, such as prioritizing entities related to the current user.[2]

**Episode/Document Mentions Reranking** ranks results by frequency of appearance in conversations or documents, surfacing frequently referenced entities.[2]

### Search Scope Combinations

**Local Search** focuses on immediate neighbors and direct relationships, answering specific factual queries.[2]

**Global Search** examines broader graph structure and community-level patterns to answer thematic questions.[2]

**Combined Hybrid Search** performs semantic + lexical + BFS across edges, nodes, and communities simultaneously, then reranks with RRF, MMR, or cross-encoder. This provides the most comprehensive results.[2]

### Implementation Strategies

For your Neo4j schema, you can implement:

1. **Vector indexes** on Page.embedding, Entity.embedding, Column.embedding, and Relationship.embedding for semantic search[9]
2. **Full-text indexes** on Entity.text, Document.filename, Page.content for keyword search[9]
3. **Property indexes** on user_id, org_id, entity_type for filtering[9]
4. **Composite indexes** for multi-property queries[9]
5. **Graph traversal patterns** following HAS_PAGE → MENTIONS → RELATIONSHIP chains[9]

Each search type has different performance characteristics and optimal use cases, so the best strategy often involves combining multiple approaches based on query complexity and data structure.[4][1][2]
