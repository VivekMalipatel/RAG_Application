Scenario:

First it has Text
Next It has Image
	In the image,
		There is a photo hanging on a wall
				The Photo has cat on the left side
				The Photo has Graph (Image) on the right side
						The graph as some time series representation
						There is Text describing the graph
		There is a Text right side of the wall
		There is Text Under the Photo
Next It has some text Describing the Image
